Here i have reversed the entire application so you have working code that does the same

We are prompted to enter a string like in teh example before

then the almost the same check function is called where the sum of the integers in our string are added.
if the sum is equal to 16 at any point another function is called "parell"

the parell function checks if the entire integer entered is even:

	if (!(integer & 1))
		printf("correct")
	printf("false")

examples:
	- "5542" would work since teh numbers add up to 16 and the number in total is 16
	- "5551" would pass teh first check equalling up to 16 but its not even so it would fail
	- "22222222" would pass
