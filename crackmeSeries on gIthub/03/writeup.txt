Here we are prompted to input an Integer again
Then the password is generated again the same way as before -> 338724 is the password

but instead of directly comparing our input to this number a function is called in which it is compared.
This function cmps the values and then calls a shift function with a string

These two strings are either "valid password" or "incorrect password"
the shift function has been rewritten. All it does is shift all characters 3 down so for example 'd' would become 'a'
After identifing which output is what it is clear that 338724 is the password
