Here we are prompted to entera  string but be careful as this string should only use integers

then a check function is called with our input as the argument
This check function then goes through our string and adds up all the numbers in it.
If the sum at any point is equal to 15 the password is correct.

for example: "555" but also "5551" would be correct since it would jump out of the loop before adding the one
"556" would be incorrect as the sum would total 16 and once the whole string has been gone through it prints "Password incorrect" and exits
